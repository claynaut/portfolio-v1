Hello! I'm J.S. Pescasio. I'm a third-year undergraduate studying CS at UC Riversde. I'm greatly interested in software and web development. Feel free to say hello!

This is my personal website running on Gatsby where I'll have an overview of myself and my personal work. I started this website as a way to learn more about modern web development, so it's a constant work in progress as I learn and try new things.
